Your are given a grid with one or more shapes in it.

The red shape (represented by R's) can be rotated (90, 180, 270 degrees), flipped horizontally, shifted (left, right, up, down), or left static.

Your task is to determine the transformation that was applied to the shape.

Here is the grid before the transformation:
{formatter.grid_to_text(np.array(sample.grid_before), letter_mapping)}

Here is the grid after the transformation:
{formatter.grid_to_text(np.array(sample.grid_after), letter_mapping)}

Your answer should be one of the following: rotate, flip, shift, static
Only answer with either rotate, flip, shift, or static. Nothing else.
